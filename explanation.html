        <h1>CardChess</h1>
        <h3>Explanation</h3>
        <p><a href = "index.html">Game</a></p>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>CardChess is a variant of chess based on turn-based card games. Players draw and play cards which correspond to the pieces that they may place on the chess board.</p>
        <h3>Modes</h3>
        <p>There are two main modes to play: local & online. Local games take place with two players sharing one device. They pass the device between each other so as not to reveal their hand. Online games require an 8 character alphanumeric code to be entered to either create or join a room.</p>
        <h3>Gameplay</h3>
        <p>A player begins their turn by drawing a card. The very first card one draws will be a king. Afterwards, the drawn cards vary in probability based on the original chess distribution. After drawing a card, a player may either play the card, placing the corresponding piece within their first two rows, or move a piece.</p>
        <p>If a player is in check, this check may be evaded or blocked, as in standard chess, or it may be blocked by the placement of a card, if possible. If this is not possible, the card will not be placeable.</p>
        <p>Players have a card limit of 16 cards in their hand. After reaching 16, a player's turn will immediately begin, with no need to draw to start.</p>
        <p>CardChess does not have castling, due to the variable placement of kings and rooks.</p>
        <p>CardChess does, however, have pawn promotion. Relatedly, pawns will be able to move two spaces on their first move, regardless of whether they are placed in the first or second row. From thereon, the pawn will only be able to move one space at a time.</p>
        <h3>Controls</h3>
        <p>Most menu options are navigated through clicks, key presses, or typing.</p>
        <p>Drawing a card, selecting a card to place, placing a card, and moving a piece all involve clicks to the associated parts of the screen.</p>
        <p>If a piece or card is selected, it may be unselected by pressing the escape key.</p>
        <p>If one is playing in local mode, they should pass the device to the opponent upon arriving at the "Switching Turn" screen. Then, the opponent should press the enter key to reenter the scene.</p>
